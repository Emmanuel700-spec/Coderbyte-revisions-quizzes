This is a sample text with some words that could potentially be palindromes. We need to find out which words are palindromes. A palindrome is a word that reads the same backward as forward.

For instance, words like "level" and "radar" are palindromes, but words like "hello" and "world" are not. Let's find all palindromes in this list. 

Here are some more examples: "deified", "madam", "civic", "refer". They should be identified as palindromes by our script.
